# Font/Theme button interaction

The Main Edit Font/Theme surface adopts `kit_ui 0.13.1` and
`kit_workspace_authoring 0.6.1`. Shared source is pinned to
`ad3b83b64df01770308ef52b4443252d4717266e`; the earlier Vulkan geometry/texture
contract remains in force.

A press owns its button until release or cancellation. Release inside that same
enabled control activates the existing host action; release-only and cross-button
releases do nothing. Tab/Shift-Tab navigate visible enabled Font/Theme controls.
Enter/Space activate the focused control on release, with repeat suppressed.
A blue underline identifies keyboard/pointer focus. Ctrl-Tab retains the existing
surface-cycle shortcut, Ctrl-Enter retains Apply, and Escape retains Cancel unless
it is first cancelling an armed button press. Enter with no button focus still
uses the existing Apply behavior.

The host owns modal/text-entry scope, coordinate space, preview action dispatch
and accepted-only persistence. The shared interaction context cannot edit the
DB or text-entry targets. Apply/Cancel retain the existing baseline semantics. Pane-mode
input and the normal runtime HUD remain on their existing input paths. Focus and
capture reset on focus loss/resize/hide/minimize and when the Font/Theme scope is
inactive or blocked. The existing UI derives visual button state and draws the
shared marker without changing input ownership. Quit remains with the app
lifecycle owner even while authoring is active.

Validation:

```sh
make clean
make ui-interaction-self-test
make test
make vulkan-rollout-self-test
make package-desktop-main-edit-self-test
```

The replay uses production adapters and archives, applies real text-size previews,
checks press origin, keyboard release/repeat, disabled focus order, quit passthrough
and the marker in the actual Font/Theme panel command stream. The panel buttons
now draw shared rounded appearance and full hover/press/selection/focus state. Runtime tests use a disposable private directory. Native
lifecycle and package gates are separate from replay and human visual acceptance.

The shared [interaction contract](../third_party/codework_shared/docs/UI_INTERACTION_CONTRACT.md)
defines exact semantics and later rollout boundaries. Broader runtime controls,
text entry/IME, pane composition and native Linux qualification remain later work.
